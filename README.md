# SpyID
SpyID is a simple Python tool that retrieves the Telegram user ID of any public account using their @username. It runs from the command line, requires no bot, and works with your own Telegram credentials through the official API. Fast, lightweight, and fully local â€” ideal for devs, testers, and curious minds.
